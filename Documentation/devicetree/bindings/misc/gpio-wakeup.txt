GPIO WAKEUP DRIVER BINDINGS

Required:

	compatible:	Must be "gpio-wakeup"
	gpios:		At list of GPIO nodes that are enabled as wakeup
			sources.

	Last wake source (the interrupt number in the list) could be read from
	/sys/bus/platform/drivers/gpio-wakeup/wake_source

Example:

	wake_up {
		compatible = "gpio-wakeup";
		interrupts-extended = <&gpio0 19 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>,
			<&gpio1 20 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	};
